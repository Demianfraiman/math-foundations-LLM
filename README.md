# Why Do Transformers Work?
## A Mathematical Theory via Optimal Transport

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis in Data Science (Universidad de Buenos Aires),
where I develop a **rigorous mathematical framework** to explain why Transformer architectures
are capable of representing complex semantic relationships.

The central idea is to reinterpret **attention mechanisms as entropic optimal transport operators**
acting on probability measures over embedding spaces.

## 🎯 Problem

Modern Transformer-based language models exhibit an impressive ability to capture semantic,
syntactic, and contextual relationships between tokens.  
Despite their empirical success, there is still **no clear mathematical theory** explaining:

- What class of semantic relations Transformers can represent
- Whether attention mechanisms have intrinsic expressive limitations
- In what precise sense Transformers are *universal approximators*

This thesis addresses these questions from a **functional-analytic and measure-theoretic perspective**.

## 🧠 Main Idea

Instead of viewing attention as a purely algorithmic operation, the thesis proposes a new viewpoint:

- Texts are modeled as **probability measures** over an embedding space
- Attention matrices are interpreted as **joint probability measures**
- Semantic relations are formalized as **coupling-valued maps**
- Transformers are seen as learning **continuous maps between spaces of measures**

Within this framework, we present a new transformers like architecture combined with sinkhorn algorithm.

## 🔍 Auxiliary Results in Optimal Transport

In addition to its main results on Transformer architectures, the thesis establishes
several auxiliary results that may be of independent interest in **optimal transport theory**:

- A geometric characterization of continuous coupling-valued maps as a **convex affine subset**
  of a Banach space, enabling functional-analytic approximation arguments.

- Approximation of arbitrary transport plans by plans admitting **continuous, strictly positive
  densities**, allowing reduction to entropic optimal transport.

- A Γ-convergence result for entropically regularized Kantorovich functionals as the
  regularization parameter tends to zero.

- Stability and universality properties of **Sinkhorn operators** viewed as nonlinear maps
  between spaces of probability measures.


These results are developed in a purely measure-theoretic and variational framework and
are largely independent of the machine learning motivation.

## 📐 Mathematical Framework

The work combines tools from:

- Functional analysis and aproximation theory
- Measure theory
- Optimal transport (classical and entropic)
- Convex analysis

## ⭐ Main Result (Informal)

> **Universal Approximation of Semantic Couplings**  
>  
> Any continuous system of semantic relations between texts—modeled as probability measures—
> can be approximated arbitrarily well by a Transformer architecture whose attention layer
> is implemented via a Sinkhorn (entropic optimal transport) operator.

This provides a **mathematically precise sense** in which Transformers are universal
approximators of semantic structure.
